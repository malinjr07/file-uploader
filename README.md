# Drag and Drop File Upload in Reactjs / Nextjs

## A Custom Made Drag-and-Drop Image/File Uploader

**It's interesting**

You Should Try it too.!

### As A Begginer

I have been wondering how can I make various image uploader. The Packages doesn't provide much of a support on customization, neither we have _plenty_ of resources. That's why, I have taken an initiative to build a Drag-And-Drop Builder.

### No Extra/3rd party Library has used

**As I mention Before** No packages satisfied me, so I just built this one in Reactjs, Tailwind CSS

### But You have used Next.js Cheater!

Becuase, even Reactjs suggest to use Next.js for Server-Side Projects. And as a developer, we all know, **Most of the projects are connected with server, and has complex UI**. So, I have just used the Framework on top of React.

### But Hey don't worry, I haven't used any Server-Side Feature of Next.js

The Codes are completely client-side. (_useEffect hook_) Which any developer has learned as a begineer of ReactJs journey.
